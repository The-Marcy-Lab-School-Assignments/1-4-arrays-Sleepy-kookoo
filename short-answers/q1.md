# Question

Look at the following code:

```js
let name = "mike";
const changeName = (nameToChange) => {
  nameToChange = "tom";
};
changeName(name);
console.log(name);

const favoriteLocations = ["New York City", "Jersey City"];
const addBostonToFavorites = (locations) => {
  locations.unshift("Boston");
};
addBostonToFavorites(favoriteLocations);
console.log(favoriteLocations);
```

Why was `favoriteLocations` changed, but `name` was not?

# Answer
    The `favoriteLocations` was changed because it was modified by the addBostonToFavorites. The addBostonToFavorites changed the favoriteLocation function through the `.unshift`. Therefore, it was a impure function. While the `name` was not changed because name was not being modified. Therefore, it was a pure function.
